This is just a small repo to give a quick introduction into writing unit tests and using a CI platform to automatically run them on your branch whenever code is being commited.
There are many benefits to this:

- ...etc (fill out later)

Tech used:
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
