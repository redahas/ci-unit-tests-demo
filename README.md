This is just a small repo to give a quick introduction into writing unit tests and using a CI platform to automatically run them on your branch whenever code is being commited.
There are many benefits to this:
- Git checks can be configured so that a Pull Request with failing unit tests cannot be merged.
- ...etc (fill out later)

Tech used:
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - A popular and reliable javascript unit testing framework
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) - A package manager
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) - A continuous integration service
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - A platform for creating and working with containers
